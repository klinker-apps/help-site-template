          "<b>Reasons</b>" + br() +
          "This will be the more technical part of this post, if you don't want to read and understand it, then you will have to just accept my answer from above. If you don't accept that I know what I am talking about... Then by all means, read on, I will try to keep it as simple as possible." + brbr() +
          "To access Twitter, they have provided us with the REST APIs (currently version 1.1). These APIs allow developers to communicate with Twitter in real time by just submitting requests to get data from the network. They make it relatively simple - if you know what your doing - to obtain the data that they allow you to get and store, but there are plenty of limitations to these APIs, which make sense: Twitter is a completely free service and make their money off of advertisements. They want people to use their official Twitter products (such as the web or their own Android app) to access their services because they are able to place advertisements in them and that is the only way they make money. So they just aren't going to make some things available for 3rd party developers." + brbr() +
          "One of those things is their push notification system. As I said before, they allow us to access their services with these REST APIs, but they also had a Streaming API available so that a 3rd party service, such as this one, could be always connected. Sounds great right? Unfortunately, Twitter shut these streaming services down. No apps can access them any longer." + brbr() +

          "<b>Twitter Push Notification Interceptor</b>" + br() +
          "Talon has the ability to watch for the official Twitter app's push notifications. When one of that app's notifications goes off, Talon will basically hijack it and replace it with it's own notification. This is probably the ideal solution for most users. To learn more about how it works and set it up, please see the <i>\"interceptor\"</i> topic, below." + brbr() +

          "<b>Conclusion</b>" + br() +
          "Thanks for the read, if you made it all the way, hope that gives you an idea as to why push notifications just aren't even an option at this point and what my solution to that problem has been, even if it is not ideal. It works, and it seems to be working quite well for me."

          "Basically, whenever a Twitter notification comes in, Talon will grab that notification, and dismiss it through Android's " + link("NotificationListenerService APIs", "https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/notification/NotificationListenerService.html") + ", then replace that notification with my own." + brbr() +
          "The notification will kick off a specific <i>Activity</i> refresh within Talon. Talon has had an <i>Activity</i> page for a few years now. It doesn't match Twitter's notification section, but it provides likes, retweets, new followers, quotes, and mentions when possible. Twitter has no official API for most of these things, so this section is a bit of a hacky workaround. It does work for the majority of people, but there are a number of reasons why it might not work for you (tweeting a lot or having a protected account are the big ones)." + brbr() +
          "After the <i>Activity</i> refresh is complete, Talon will provide you with a notification for anything that is new. And that's it." + brbr() +

          "Any notifications that Talon cannot support from the official app, at this time, will be dismissed as well. Talon does not currently have a way to blacklist these notifications so they don't get dismissed. If you want favorite user notifications, you can set them up through Talon, by favoriting that user within my app, then turning on a background refresh interval for the home timeline." + brbr() +
